//! Integration tests for the `active_i3c` strap selection.
//!
//! These tests verify that the MCU firmware can boot successfully when
//! `McuStraps.active_i3c` is set to select the second I3C core (i3c1).
//! Both ROM and runtime are compiled with the `active-i3c1` feature so
//! that the entire boot chain uses the second I3C core consistently.

    /// `start_runtime_hw_model` waits for the runtime to boot
    /// (`check_booted_to_runtime`), so if it returns the boot succeeded.
